// Models are defined through the Schema interface. 
// Remember that a collection represents an entity in our app. 
// e.g. users, products, blogposts. 
// A schema represents how a collection looks like. 
// This means that each document in the collection would have the fields specified in the schema.

// We access the database via mongoose.model. 
// The first argument is the singular name of the collection your model is for. 
// Mongoose automatically looks for the plural version of your model name. 
// In our case, because we use BlogPost, Mongoose will create the model for our BlogPosts collection,
// not BlogPost collection.
